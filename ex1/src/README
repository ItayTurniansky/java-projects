1) clever player -
trying to fill the first row by order from left to right.
if the spot is taken he chooses randomly just like the whatever player
genius player -
similar to the clever player the genius player first tries to fill the first row
then the first column by order,
if the spot is full he chooses a random spot to fill just like the whatever player.

2) the main advantages of implementing a common interface for all players is
creating compatibility with the board, game, tournament classes and by that making
a generic code that will work on all player types created and those who will be created in the future.
it also makes changes allot easier to follow,
and makes sure all classes implementing the interface are changed accordingly.
it made the writing allot easier
and made sure im not forgetting the most important method.
this principle is called polymorphism and is one the pillars of OOP.
