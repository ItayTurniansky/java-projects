1)ascii_art package- contains:
 KeyboardInput- handles user shell input.
 AsciiArtAlgorithm - runs the full asciiArt algorithm on given parameters and picture
 AsciiArtCache - singleton class that saves the last rendered ascii picture for runtime saving.
 Shell - handles all shell commands from user according to instructions.

image package - contains:
Image - image object class for further algorithm use.
ImageProcessor - class with static methods for processing images (pad and split).

image_char_matching - contains:
CharConverter - used for changing chars to bool array for ascii algorithm.
SubImgCharMatcher - ascii algorithm implementation.

ascii_output - contains:
AsciiOutput - interface for ascii output types
ConsoleAsciiOutput - used for printing the ascii result to the console
HtmlAsciiOutput - used for creating an html file with the ascii output.

2) i used TreeMap in the SubImgCharMatcher class for keeping the ascii algorithm values
 of each char in the charset.
i used TreeMap because it also sorts the keys by their value(ascii code for chars)
so it automatically fills the exercise
instructions for printing the charset ordered by ascii value,
it orders the chars by their ascii in case their ascii algorithm value is the same.
this data structure maintains o(log(n)) runtime complexity for inserting, deletion and getting.
memory allocation is the same as all maps and is efficient.

-i also created a singleton class for the AsciiArtAlgorithm for keeping the latest result
 in case of rerunning with the same values. and by that saving runtime and memory allocations.

3) i used java exception mechanism in the shell and AsciiAlgorithm.
- throwing IO exceptions in case of image being wrongly rendered or wrong path
- throwing IllegalArgument Exceptions in all cases provided
 in the instruction in the shell class.(wrong commands/arguments)
 I caught all exceptions in the shell class and printed the instructed output based on each exception.

4)first change i made in the SubUmgCharMatcher class API was adding getCharMap public method.
this method returns the charset map used in the shell for printing the charset given the char command.
second change - added round field for keeping the chosen way to round chosen by the user.

5)No Changes were made to the other given classes.
